The procrastinator is often remarkably 
optimistic about his ability to complete    
a task on a tight deadline; this is usua    lly accompanied by expressions of 
reassurance that everything is under control. (Therefore, there is no need to start.) 
Lulled by a false sense of security, time passes. At some point, he crosses over an 
maginary starting time and suddenly realizes, "Oh no! 
I am not in control! There isn't enough time!"
